Hello, World! My name's Matvei, I'm now doing my Python project for MIPT course.

Bla bla bla? Yes, bla. Today I'm curious to find out if my bot 1234567890!!! is working properly.

Ciphertext example

One of the earliest and simplest ciphers is the Caesar cipher, which uses a symmetric key
algorithm. The key acts as a shared secret between two (or more) parties that can be used to
 send secret information no one can read without a copy of the key.

The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is "shifted"
a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be B, B
 would be replaced by C, etc. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used
  it to communicate with his generals.

Here is an example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the Caesar cipher.
The text to be encrypted is "defend the east wall of the castle," with a shift (key) of 1.

    Plaintext: defend the east wall of the castle
